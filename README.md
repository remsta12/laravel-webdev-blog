# laravel-webdev-blog
Blog Site made with Laravel to learn the framework

This was a personal project so I can have my own site that I can use to showcase some of my web development abilities on top of possibly hosting code samples of other work. Made using laravel and implementing a MySQL database and Apache server I wanted to demonstrate I can use these to make a functional, coherent site.

This is strcutured as a blog with the standard CMS back end that hosts all database information to be subjected to CRUD.

Being made with the help of a few CSS templates, I implemented all other front end & server functionality. This ensures that posts can be added from the site itself with formatting using the CMS.
