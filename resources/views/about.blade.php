    <h2>Raison d'etre</h2>
    <p>Essentially I am viewing this as a centralised hub for various writings and code projects that I want to display to people.
      Using this as a portfolio makes sense as obviously it will show that I am able to develop my own website, on top of providing
    avenues for my other works to be displayed.</p>
    <p>With regards to the website, anything fancy or impressive that I can implement within it will only help my cause, where
    I seek to sell myself to a corporation so they will be so gracious to endow me with a job with their fine institution.</p>
